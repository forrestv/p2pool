**P2pool setup overview**


P2pool is a pool server designed for local use within a single mining farm, but which will communicate with other people's mining farms in order to distribute mining risk and reduce reward variance. You will need a server or VPS on which to run the p2pool software in addition to any mining hardware you have. It is recommended to run your own p2pool server ("node") if you can, but if that is not an option for you, you may also use a public p2pool node. Your income will be somewhat higher if you set up a high-performance node on your LAN than if you use a public node, especially for the BTC and LTC networks. Performance is largely determined by single-threaded CPU speed, but network connectivity is also important.


**P2pool installation with pypy -- Windows**


On Windows, pypy is only supported via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). P2pool on pypy on WSL is much faster than P2pool on
CPython on native Windows. To install WSL, first follow the steps outlined here:


https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide


Once you've done that, run bash and follow the rest of the steps below.


**P2pool installation with pypy -- Linux and Windows**


Copy and paste the following commands into a bash shell in order to install p2pool on Windows or Linux.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install pypy pypy-dev pypy-setuptools gcc build-essential git


    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo pypy
    sudo rm setuptools-*.zip


    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/z/zope.interface/zope.interface-4.1.3.tar.gz#md5=9ae3d24c0c7415deb249dd1a132f0f79 tar zxf zope.interface-4.1.3.tar.gz
    cd zope.interface-4.1.3/
    sudo pypy setup.py install
    cd ..
    sudo rm -r zope.interface-4.1.3*


    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/T/Twisted/Twisted-15.4.0.tar.bz2
    tar jxf Twisted-15.4.0.tar.bz2
    cd Twisted-15.4.0
    sudo pypy setup.py install
    cd ..
    sudo rm -r Twisted-15.4.0*


    git clone https://github.com/jtoomim/p2pool.git
    cd p2pool
    git checkout 1mb_segwit


You'll also need to install and run your bitcoind or altcoind of choice, and edit ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf (or the corresponding file for litecoin or whatever other coin you intend to mine) with your bitcoind's RPC username and password. Launch your bitcoind or altcoind, and after it has finished downloading blocks and syncing, go to your p2pool directory and run


    pypy run_p2pool.py


**jtoomimnet vs mainnet**


If you wish to use the original forrestv btc mainnet instead of jtoomimnet, then replace


    git clone https://github.com/jtoomim/p2pool.git
    cd p2pool
    git checkout 1mb_segwit


above with


    git clone https://github.com/p2pool/p2pool.git
    cd p2pool


Note: The BTC p2pools currently have low hashrate, which means that payouts will be infrequent, large, and unpredictable. As of Feb 2018, blocks are found on jtoomimnet on average once every 25 days, and blocks are found on mainnet on average once every 108 days. Do not mine on BTC p2pool unless you are very patient and can tolerate receiving no revenue for several months.


**Miner setup**


P2pool communicates with miners via the stratum protocol. For BTC, configure your miners with the following information:


    URL: stratum+tcp://(Your node's IP address or hostname):9332
    Worker: (Your bitcoin address)
    Password: x


For Litecoin, replace 9332 with 9327. For Bitcoin Cash, use 9348. For Dash, use 7903.


The mining address must be a regular P2PKH address. Segwit, multisig, and bech32 addresses are not supported. That means an address starting with a 1 for Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash or an L for Litecoin. If you use an address that p2pool cannot understand, then p2pool will mine to that node's default address instead.


If you wish to modify the mining difficulty, you may add something like "address+4096" after your mining address to set the pseudoshare difficulty to 4096, or "address/65536" to set the actual share difficulty to 65536 or the p2pool minimum share difficulty, whichever is higher. Pseudoshares only affect hashrate statistics, whereas actual shares affect revenue variance and efficiency.


**Firewall considerations**


If your node is behind a firewall or behind NAT (i.e. on a private IP address), you may want to forward ports to your p2pool server. P2pool uses two ports: one for p2p communication with the p2pool network, and another for both the web UI and for stratum communication with workers. For Bitcoin, those ports are 9333 (p2p) and 9332 (stratum/web). For Litecoin, they are 9326 (p2p) and 9327 (stratum/web). For Bitcoin Cash, they are 9349 (p2p) and 9348 (stratum/web).

**Fees, default mining addresses, and other considerations**

Zero-fee mining is possible and easy with P2pool, but it is not the default configuration.

By default, p2pool will include a 0.5% fee to forrestv, the inactive original developer of p2pool. If you wish, you may modify this percentage with the --give-author # command-line option.

You can set a default mining address for your node with the --address command-line option. This is useful if you want to give each miner on your LAN a separate worker name, but still all use the same address for your income. Setting a mining address is also a good idea for public nodes in case someone enters in an invalid address or worker name, as it prevents that revenue from being lost.

Public node operators can also set a fee for their node with the --fee option. When set, this percent of all revenue will go to the node's default mining address. If you are mining on someone else's public node, make sure to check that their fees are reasonable before you start mining there!

Transaction fees from mining are always distributed fairly among all miners.

P2pool also supports merged mining, but all merged mining revenue goes straight to the pool operator. It is not shared with the miners.

P2pool with currencies other than BTC

To mine Bitcoin Cash, install and run a Bitcoin Cash-supporting bitcoind (e.g. Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, or Bitcoin XT) and then launch p2pool with "pypy run_p2pool.py --net bitcoincash".

To mine Litecoin, install and run litecoind and then launch p2pool with "pypy run_p2pool.py --net litecoin". Note that the default ports for litecoind's RPC and p2p interfaces conflict with Bitcoin p2pool's ports (9332 and 9333). It is recommended to move litecoin's p2p and RPC ports by adding the following to litecoin.conf:

    rpcport=10332
    port=10333

To mine DASH, you will need to use this p2pool fork: 
  
    https://github.com/dashpay/p2pool-dash

To mine Digibyte, you can use these p2pools: 
  
    https://github.com/farsider350/p2pool-dgb-scrypt-350
    https://github.com/farsider350/p2pool-dgb-sha256-350
    https://github.com/farsider350/p2pool-dgb-skein-350

If your currency uses a hash function other than SHA256 (e.g. Litecoin's scrypt or Dash's X11), you will also need to compile support for the hash function. See https://github.com/jtoomim/p2pool/ (towards the bottom) for details.

P2pool can be used for many other cryptocurrencies than the ones listed here, but the process for setting up p2pool is not streamlined for these currencies. You may need to edit the source to add configuration files in p2pool/bitcoin/networks/(mycurrency).py and p2pool/networks/(mycurrency).py.

To solo mine with p2pool or to start a new network for a new currency, set PERSIST = False in p2pool/networks/(mycurrency).py
